Quick Summary
=============

Color to attribute is a simple plugin that will translate your current Layer
Style into an attribute in the layer attribute table, as simple as that.

It is driven from a simple UI that lets you select three options:

 * Layer Name
 * Layer attribute: where to store the color, you can select New Attribute
 * Attribute name: In case of New attribute, provide here the name

And that's it, press OK and the plugin will fill that attribute for you in
the Layer.
