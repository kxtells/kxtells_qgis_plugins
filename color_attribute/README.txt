Color to layer Plugin
---------------------

This plugin is a small plugin with a single option. Save the current layer
defined colors to an existing (or new) layer attribute.

The plugin adds a new icon to the plugin bar. It gives access to a minimal
GUI that lets you choose a layer and an attribute to hold the color.

A third option will let you define a 10 character name for a new attribute
to be created and populated.
